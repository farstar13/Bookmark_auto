Use for execution of modified AutoKittens script via bookmark

I've made a modification to Autokittens so it works properly, along with a few tweaks:
   - Added crafting options for Kerosene and Eludium.
   - Added Unicorn Utopias to "Unicorn Structures" under the "Calculators" option.
   - Tweaked "Unicorn structures" calculator to display number of additional sacrifices rather than the absolute number.
   - "autoFestival" is now more reliable.
   - Fixed displays for "AutoKittens" and "Calculators" options showing up.
   - Fixed Space buildings not appearing, now they're visible and in alphabetical order!
   - Fixed minor title display for upgraded buildings, specifically Hydro Plants appearing as "Aqueducts".
